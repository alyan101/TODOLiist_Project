The project's primary objective was to engineer a robust task management tool that exemplifies core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and a clean separation of concerns via the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. The "Luxury TODO Manager," features a high-fidelity graphical user interface (GUI) built with Swing, inspired by premium design aesthetics. It provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, task prioritization, categorical organization, and persistent data storage. This report elaborates on the requirement analysis, the MVC-based system architecture, detailed class design, implementation specifics, and the adherence to OOP concepts, thereby demonstrating a production-grade software construction process.
